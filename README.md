## What is Neko?

Neko is an autonomous AI agent specialized in offensive security. It combines the power of a large language model (LLM) with real-world capabilities by integrating with a shell, a web browser, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, and popular tools like **Ghidra** and **Burp Suite** through an MCP server.

**It's not build to replace** penetration testers, Neko is designed to **assist** them helping automate tasks, accelerate workflows, and provide intelligent interaction with common red team tools.
